## Earthquake Prediction using Machine Learning

  * Creating a Machine learning model for predicting earthquakes with features like: metereological data, latitude, longitude, magnitude of the earthquake and other geographical factors using a sufficiently large dataset.

* The basis of predicting data would not be for predicting the possibility of earthquakes of any location but also to detect the various geographical factors that govern the causes of the earthquakes so that these specific locations can get special attention from the workforce. 
 
 * We will use Google Maps API in order to detect the various nearby locations and safe points. Also it will show the locations of the nearby rescue camps.

* Data information about disaster will be periodically collected from meteorological departments both to the rescue centers and the users.

## Earthquake Prevention

* The application will display the nearby rescue centers and relief organizations to the civilian using the google maps. Each rescue team will be already registered to our main application database so that the details of the nearest rescue centers could be made easily available to the needy person. 

* The nearby rescue camp will send their member that has our application. The member will setup his wifi router hotspot using our application. The other residents of that particalar location will connect to that rescue team member using our application. The application will get to know the number of residents that are connected to the rescue team members through our application. The rescue team member then will inform the details to the corresponding team. Thus the rescue team will get to know about the workforce services and supplies required for the operation in that area.

* Our application also takes input of the rescue camp and guarantees it to be working as a part of an authorized service or organization. At every disaster rescue the application will ask the rescue team to input the details of the number of people saved and rescued but still need some medical attention. These people will be then accessed to the nearby helping centers or hospitals.

* Using the data fetched from the meteorological department we will show the locations that are not safe and their levels are above the danger points which will need special attention. Zones like highly prone area having high population having signs of danger will be alerted with various danger points. The points will be alerted as notificaions on the applications of the rescue team workers.

* Using the various danger points and safe points, we can implement a graph algorithm using Segment Tree to detect the best possible path or route that could be done to evacuate the danger points area to a safe location. 

* The disaster would be notified beforehand to the user by collecting information from the meteorological departments.

* The application also provides a variety of solutions in case of any emergency situation and alternative steps to tackle to these situations.
